# Lab1
Goal: Program the board to replicate a scrolling banner.

Scrolling banner diplays either "HELLO WORLD" or a custom display from SWs on the DE1 board.
Keys control banner's operation. (KEY0 = display mode, KEY1 = pause, KEY2 = slower scroll, KEY3 = faster scroll)

Done in Altera Monitor Program with lab1custom.amp, lab1.v, lab1custom.c, and mysystem.qsys
